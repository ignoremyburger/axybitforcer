# AxyBitforcer

Due to financial reasons from this moment onwards, AxyBitforcer will cost 10$ if you wish to get a copy for yourself.

# Do I have to pay 10$ monthly?
No, it's a one-time payment.

# How can I pay? How does it work?
I accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT. Just shoot me a message on my telegram @its_a_harvey. After confirming your payment I will send you the compiled version of the software with a full VirusTotal scan to ensure that it is not malicious. I don't have malicious intents, just trying to make a buck.

# What makes your software stands out?
Instead of constantly creating new BTC wallets using Mnemonic until one takes the bait, AxyBitforcer generates hex private keys instead. And it is faster.

# Why should I pay for this?
Idk I'm just trying to make a buck. But 10$ for a piece of software that works instead of the scammy stuff on instagram sure looks worth it.

# Do I get refunds?
No

# Can't I just clone the previous commit?
Yea of course you can, I just won't release updates for it.
