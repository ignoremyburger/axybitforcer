# AxyBitforcer

# Notice: New program (HashHound) - https://github.com/ignoremyburger/hashhound

# How much is it?
There is no set price, send whatever you want to send. I will donate all the profits from this to a local orphanage so they can have a nice Christmas.

# How can I pay? How does it work?
I accept any crypto that my wallet supports. 
After paying I will send you the code. Instructions are inside so there is a high change I won't reply to you about how it works.

# What makes your software stands out?
Instead of constantly creating new BTC wallets using Mnemonic until one takes the bait, AxyBitforcer generates hex private keys instead. And it is faster.

# Why should I pay for this?
It's like lottery. You might win and you might lose.

# Do I get refunds?
No

# Can't I just clone the previous commit?
Yea of course you can, I just won't release updates for it.
