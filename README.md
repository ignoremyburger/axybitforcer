# AxyBitforcer

<h2>What is this?</h2>
AxyBitforcer is a Bitcoin Wallet Bruteforcer. A tool that keeps generating Bitcoin Wallets until a miracle happens where it guessed the same Private Key as an existing Bitcoin wallet and send the funds to your account.<br/>
This is in no way profitable, mining Bitcoin is more profitable but why not right?

<h2>How to start</h2>
Step 1: Clone the Git repo
```
git clone https://github.com/buibaohoang06/axybitforcer
```

Step 2: Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 3: Run the Script and follow instructions
```
python3 gen.py
```

<h2>Important note</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This is purely based on luck, when you have nothing else to do on your computer maybe give this script a try.</li>
    <li>Chances of getting the same Bitcoin Private Key is 10 to the power of -77.</li>
    <li>Just to repeat, this is based purely on luck. There are no algorithms or special mechanisms. This is just based on luck.</li>
</ul>

<h3>In case you actually (somehow the universe aligned just for you) found some Bitcoin this way.</h3>
Can I please have some? ðŸ¥º
